        <p>Delhi Public School, R. K. Puram (often called DPSRKP) is a co-educational day and boarding private school educating pupils from the 6th to 12th grades, located in the South Delhi district of New Delhi, India. In addition, two separate campuses in Vasant Vihar and East of Kailash comprise the Junior or Elementary School Branch for pupils from Nursery through the 5th grade.
        Founded in 1972 in New Delhi, DPS R.K. Puram is a private institution run by the not-for-profit Delhi Public School Society. Ms. Lathashishtha served as its first Headmistress. It was the second school founded by the Delhi Public School Society, the first being the Delhi Public School at Mathura Road, and today serves as the Society's flagship school.

            In 1978, Mr. R. S. Lugani was appointed as the school's first Principal. He served as Principal until 1992, and is credited with pioneering the "DPS R.K. Puram" system, which utilizes a combination of innovative teaching methods and a result oriented curriculum and evaluation system in order to maintain consistently high academic standards. In 1992, Mr. Lugani was awarded the Government of India's fourth highest civilian honour, the Padma Shri award, by then-President of India, R. Venkataraman for his contributions in the fields of Education and Literature.[7]

Mr. Lugani was succeeded by then-Vice Principal, Dr. (Mrs.) Shayama Chona–an internationally renowned educationist and disability rights activist–who served as the school's Principal from 1992 until her retirement in August 2009. Under her leadership, the school stewarded the establishment of the Tamana Special School, a school for the education of children with special needs.[8] During her tenure, the school also began admitting students with visual and other impairments. Dr. Chona was conferred with the Padma Shri in 1999, and subsequently with the Government of India's third-highest civilian honour, the Padma Bhushan award in 2008–making her the only educationist to receive two of the country's four highest civilian honors.[9] In 2002, the school was felicitated at the "Computer Literacy Excellence Awards for Schools" by then-President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam as the "Best School at the State (Delhi) Level" and the second runner-up for the entire country.[10] After Dr. Chona's retirement from the position of Principal in the year 2009, Dr. D.R. Saini served as Principal till March 2015, when he was succeeded by Ms. Vanita Sehgal. Ms. Sehgal was succeeded by Ms. Padma Shrinivasan in April 2020.
